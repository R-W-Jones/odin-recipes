        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Katsu curry is a Japanese dish that combines a crispy, breaded cutlet, typically made from chicken or pork, with a rich, mildly spiced curry sauce. The cutlet is deep-fried to a golden brown, providing a crunchy texture that contrasts beautifully with the thick, flavorful curry.</p>
        <p>The curry sauce is usually poured over the katsu and served alongside steamed rice. It's a comforting and hearty dish, with a balance of savory, slightly sweet, and umami flavors that make it a popular choice in both casual dining and home-cooked meals.</p>
